title: Week five
---

This week was very stressful but rewarding nonetheless. Phase 1 of our big web project was due on Tuesday. We turned it in literally 30 seconds before it was due. There was so much more we wanted to do with the site but time didn’t allow. Hopefully these last two weeks will be enough time to make our Crossfit site exactly how we imagine! This week, we plan on adding many more athletes, regions, and events to our database as well as improve how everything looks. I will specifically be working on adding the social network feeds to the rest API. 

Class has been very interactive this week. Professor Downing introduced us to database vocabulary. We learned about select, project, cross join, theta join, and natural join; all of which are actions that can be performed in SQL. We got the chance to brainstorm with our classmates about how these algorithms would look in Python. Usually, my first solution to a problem ends up looking very messy and unnecessarily long. This time, I tried to first write out my messy solution, and then look at everything as a whole to figure out how I can condense it and make it more understandable. Python is perfectly adaptable when it comes to condensing code. 

We didn’t have class on Friday because it was finals day for 6 week courses. I had my Computer Security final on Friday. I enjoyed that class, but I am glad it is over because I would very much like to spend all of my energy toward Software Engineering.

Tip of the week: The Pycharm profession edition has a neat database feature. In the upper right hand corner, if you click on the database selection, you will see a list of all the tables you have in your database. Opening one up will bring up the table and allow you to edit the table. You can do anything from adding an entry to deleting an attribute. It is very convenient!
