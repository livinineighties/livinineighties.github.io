title: Week four

This week went a lot better than expected. I was very nervous about the exam but it went very well. I spent all of the weekend before studying for it. I reread all of my notes and Professor Downing’s Python examples but I think the most useful thing I did was attend a study session. During the study session, we focused a lot on how Python works. We didn’t try to memorize syntax; we focused on trying to write built-in Python functions on our own. This proved to be quite challenging but very rewarding. It was also probably the best preparation technique for the midterm. 

After the exam was over, we began talking about our next project. This project is going to be a three phase project which consists of us, (my team of 5), building an “imdb” like site. Our site is going to be “Crossfit Social” which is basically going to be a database of Crossfit information such as athletes, events, and regions. We plan on incorporating Crossfit’s twitter feed and Instagram in the website as well. My group and I have already spent countless hours learning Django, the required web framework, and getting it to work with the HTML and Python files. I think my favorite part about this assignment so far has been creating templates. Templates are basically what you see when you open a page, the page layout. I don’t know HTML but I am learning it along the way. Customization is exciting, especially when combined with programming techniques. I am looking forward to the rest of this semester and seeing the project when it is complete.

Tip of the day: Definitely use the Pycharm Professional Edition (free for 30 days) for this project. It supports Django and GitHub. It has been a life saver for us so far.
