title: Week seven
---

This week was pretty much our last week of class. On Monday, we had a guest speaker from Mutual Mobile, John McIntosh, come lecture us. He talked about a lot of interesting things such as contributing to open source. He went through the in depth process one should take if they want to contribute. I found this to be very valuable information, especially since I am graduating soon. I want to do all that I can to ensure my resume catches the attention of probable employers. I feel that if I make some significant contribution to an open source, then that would definitely add spark to my list of achievements. 

On Wednesday and Friday, we had class presentations. Every group had the chance to show off the website they have been working on for the last three weeks. I was impressed by how well everyone did. It was cool to see how well each group was able to overcome the learning curve of all these new technologies and make something great from them. My group and I gave our presentation on Friday. It went better than expected. I tend to have severe anxiety when it comes to public speaking but I was able to overcome it. I was a little disappointed that Professor Downing wasn’t able to attend the presentation days. I think he would have been very proud of everyone’s presentations! 

All in all, this was one of the best classes I have taken at UT. I have learned so much these past 9 weeks. Even though some of the tools were difficult to work with at first, they eventually became second nature and a worthwhile experience. I learned a lot about Python, good coding practices, industry programming techniques, and many new technologies that I am sure I will be using again in the future. After the final exam on Monday, I plan on using everything I have learned to work on side projects that will be valuable to me, and maybe even the programming community. 

Tip of the week: Take advantage of everything Bootstrap has to offer! Bootstrap makes designing the front end of a website much easier by providing simple tools and functionality that can be easily incorporated in your program. It is very intuitive to use and will save you a lot of time with web development.
